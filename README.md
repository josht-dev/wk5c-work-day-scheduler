# work-day-scheduler

## Description

To help users time box their daily tasks for the work day, this scheduler will allow them to add events to hour slots and save them locally. When they reload the page, it will retrieve any saved data and color code the times depending on if the hour slot is from the past, present, or for the future. The jQeury and Day.js API's were used for this project. Starter files with the Bootstrap framework were provided.
